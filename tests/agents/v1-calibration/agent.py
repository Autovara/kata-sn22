"""The version-1 calibration agent, kept for the SANDBOX path only.

NOT the reference submission. The agent miners copy lives in
``kata/submissions/sn22__desearch/miner/`` and is a version-2 ``kata_sn22_sdk`` agent, because that
is what the sealed room runs.

This file exists because the two paths have not converged yet:

* the **room** speaks protocol 2 -- an ``Agent`` subclass, imported by the harness, streaming via
  ``emit``, answering the four upstream pools;
* the **sandbox** still speaks protocol 1 -- a script reading one task on stdin and writing one JSON
  document on stdout, scored on ``summary``/``results``/``citations``.

Phase E and Phase F of the production plan replace the sandbox's task manifest and scorer with the
upstream ones, at which point this file has no job and should be deleted. Until then it is what
proves the sandbox seam actually works end to end -- the relay socket, the capability, the billing
and the scoring -- with a real agent rather than a stub.

Keeping it HERE rather than in the competition repository is the point: nothing a miner is shown
speaks version 1 any more.

Its original docstring follows.

A reference SN22 agent: valid rather than good.

It does the things every submission must do, and nothing else:

1. read one task from stdin and answer on stdout, in protocol version 1;
2. search through ``sn22_relay`` — the ONLY way out. In the local sandbox the lane puts that module
   in the run directory; in the sealed room the agent image ships it. Either way you write the same
   line, and there is no reason for a submission to import ``socket`` or ``urllib`` (both of which
   the screen rejects);
3. return exactly ``limits.max_results`` results — fewer takes the upstream count penalty, more is
   a contract violation;
4. **supply evidence for every source**, which is the part worth understanding before anything else.

**How a source earns anything.** The validator fetches every page you return, itself, and checks
that your ``highlights`` appear IN ORDER in its own copy of that page AND in your own ``text``
about it. A source that fails either check is dropped before it is ever judged — it does not score
badly, it does not score at all. So:

* quote CONTIGUOUS, REAL spans of the page. Reassembling a page's vocabulary into a sentence nobody
  wrote fails the ordering check, which is exactly what it is for;
* say the same thing in ``text`` that your highlights say. Pasting real excerpts beside an answer
  written from somewhere else fails the second direction of the check;
* only what survives is sent to the judge, and it is judged on the EXCERPTS, not the page — you are
  graded on what you proved you read.

**What a citation costs.** A citation counts only when you actually returned that source and that
source passed evidence. Citing a URL you did not return is free to write and earns nothing, and
citing a source whose excerpts did not check out is worse than citing nothing at all.

Its retrieval strategy is one relay call with the query verbatim. Beating that is the starting
point, not the goal — a real agent reformulates, searches more than once, ranks what comes back,
and quotes the passages that actually answer the question rather than the first lines of the page.
This one has a whole spare quota it never touches.

**Where your search calls are paid for depends on where you run**, and you do not have to care:

* in the local **sandbox**, the lane pays and meters you — ``sn22_relay.quota()`` reports what is
  left, and running out is a refusal;
* in the sealed **room**, YOU pay, with the credential you sealed to your bundle. There is no lane
  quota to read, so ``quota()`` reports ``metered: False`` and the only limit is your own budget.

The same ``agent.py`` runs in both. That is deliberate: a score you measure in the sandbox only
predicts a score in the room if nothing about your agent changes between them.

Standard library only, plus ``sn22_relay``. Nothing is installed at run time, in either place.
